- Registration window validation

---

### 4. Digital Ticketing System
**Description**: Automated ticket generation with QR codes and email delivery.

**Core Entities**: Ticket, Registration, QRCode
**Core Methods**: generateTicket(), sendTicket(), updateTicketStatus()
**Design Patterns**: Factory (TicketFactory), Template Method (TicketGeneration)
**Business Rules**:
- Unique QR code per ticket
- Ticket generated after registration confirmation
- Email delivery confirmation

---

## **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)**
*Priority: MEDIUM - Important for completeness*

### 5. Speaker Profile & Materials Management
**Description**: Speaker functionality to manage profiles and upload presentation materials.

**Core Entities**: SpeakerProfile, PresentationMaterial, User
**Core Methods**: createProfile(), uploadMaterial(), updateProfile()
**Design Patterns**: Strategy (FileUploadStrategy), Observer (MaterialUploadNotification)
**Business Rules**:
- Only speakers can manage speaker profiles
- File size and type validation
- Material organization by session

---

### 6. Speaker-Event Assignment
**Description**: Admin functionality to assign speakers to events and sessions.

**Core Entities**: SpeakerAssignment, Event, SessionSlot, SpeakerProfile
**Core Methods**: assignSpeakerToEvent(), assignSpeakerToSession(), removeSpeakerAssignment()
**Design Patterns**: Strategy (AssignmentStrategy), Observer (AssignmentNotification)
**Business Rules**:
- One speaker can be assigned to multiple sessions
- Speaker must accept assignment before session
- Assignment can be cancelled before event starts

---

### 7. Multi-Track Session Management
**Description**: Admin functionality to create and manage multiple tracks within events.

**Core Entities**: EventTrack, SessionSlot, TrackAssignment, Event
**Core Methods**: createTrack(), assignSessionToTrack(), manageTrackSchedule()
**Design Patterns**: Builder (TrackBuilder), Strategy (TrackManagementStrategy)
**Business Rules**:
- Multiple tracks can exist within single event
- Sessions belong to specific tracks
- No overlapping sessions in same track
- Track capacity management

---

### 8. Schedule Management
**Description**: Admin functionality to create schedules and manage session timing.

**Core Entities**: SessionSlot, Event, EventTrack
**Core Methods**: createSession(), updateSessionTiming(), manageSchedule()
**Design Patterns**: Builder (ScheduleBuilder), Strategy (SchedulingStrategy)
**Business Rules**:
- No overlapping sessions in same room
- Session timing within event duration
- Session capacity management

---

### 9. Ticket Validation & Attendance Tracking
**Description**: Real-time ticket validation and attendance tracking at event venues.

**Core Entities**: Ticket, Attendance, StaffUser
**Core Methods**: validateTicket(), recordAttendance(), trackCheckins()
**Design Patterns**: Strategy (ValidationStrategy), Observer (AttendanceNotification)
**Business Rules**:
- QR code validation
- Prevent duplicate check-ins
- Real-time attendance updates

---

## **Phase 4: Enhancement (Weeks 7-8)**
*Priority: LOW - Nice to have*

### 10. Automated Notifications
**Description**: Automated email and push notifications for various system events.

**Core Entities**: Notification, EmailTemplate, User
**Core Methods**: sendNotification(), scheduleReminder(), handleEmailDelivery()
**Design Patterns**: Observer (EventNotification), Strategy (NotificationStrategy)
**Business Rules**:
- Configurable notification preferences
- Delivery status tracking
- Retry mechanism for failed deliveries

---

### 11. Feedback Collection & Reporting
**Description**: Post-event feedback collection and comprehensive reporting system.

**Core Entities**: Feedback, Report, Event
**Core Methods**: collectFeedback(), generateReport(), viewAnalytics()
**Design Patterns**: Strategy (ReportGeneration), Template Method (ReportTemplate)
**Business Rules**:
- One feedback per user per event
- Rating scale validation (1-5)
- Report generation scheduling

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Time Management
- **Time-box design phase to 45 minutes per use case** (following LLD interview approach)
- **Focus on core functionality** first
- **Iterative implementation** with feedback

### Communication Approach
- **Document user flows** in plain English
- **Identify entities** from use cases
- **Define core methods** for each entity
- **Mention design patterns** (implement when time allows)

### Quality Assurance
- **Follow SOLID principles**
- **Implement DRY, KISS patterns**
- **Handle edge cases** and exceptions
- **Write clean, maintainable code**

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Foundation use cases
2. **Create detailed flows** for each use case
3. **Implement core functionality** following LLD approach
4. **Iterate and improve** based on feedback
