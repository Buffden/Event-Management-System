Creates sessions within each track → Assigns sessions to tracks →
Sets track-specific details (capacity, room, timing) →
Attendees browse events → View available tracks →
Book for specific track sessions → System manages track capacity →
During event: Track-specific check-ins → Track attendance reporting
```
